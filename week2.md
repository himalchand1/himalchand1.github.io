Week 2:

This week started with a session by Anita Pandey, where she explained the process of writing a research paper. She emphasized the importance of choosing a good topic and outlined the key sections of a research paper: introduction, literature review, and conclusion. The rest of the week, we spent time in the lab researching our chosen topics.

Our mentor, Pelumi, guided us on how to select the best research papers to study. My research topic is about parking problems. In the lab, my teammate and I discussed the causes of parking issues and potential solutions.

In addition to the topic discussions, I also learned about the Python library, pandas, which is useful for data analysis, and machine learning. The highlight of my week was receiving a certificate of excellence in Machine Learning. I learned how to use pandas and machine learning techniques to address parking problems.

On Friday, we went to the lab and focused on creating our PowerPoint slides and making a video. We used Zoom to record the video, and our mentor was there to help us finalize the PowerPoint presentation, ensuring everything looked great and was well-organized. After completing the assignment for the day, we decided to dive deeper into learning about pandas and machine learning. We spent additional time understanding these topics better because we knew that a solid grasp of pandas and machine learning would be very helpful for our research on parking problems. This deeper knowledge will enable us to use data analysis and predictive modeling more effectively in our project.
