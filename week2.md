This week started with a session by Anita Pandey, where she explained the process of writing a research paper. She emphasized the importance of choosing a good topic and outlined the key sections of a research paper: introduction, literature review, and conclusion. The rest of the week, we spent time in the lab researching our chosen topics.

Our mentor, Pelumi, guided us on how to select the best research papers to study. My research topic is about parking problems. In the lab, my teammate and I discussed the causes of parking issues and potential solutions.

In addition to the topic discussions, I also learned about the Python library, pandas, which is useful for data analysis, and machine learning. The highlight of my week was receiving a certificate of excellence in Machine Learning. I learned how to use pandas and machine learning techniques to address parking problems.
