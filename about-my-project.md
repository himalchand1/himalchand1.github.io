## About My Project

Enhancing parking at Morgan University through a predictive model means using data to improve the parking experience for everyone on campus. The first step involves collecting information about how parking is used, such as when students and staff arrive and leave, how many cars are parked at different times, and which areas are most crowded. By analyzing this historical data, the university can gain insights into parking patterns and identify peak times when parking is in high demand.

Next, a predictive model is created using this data to forecast future parking needs. This model can predict busy periods, such as during events, exams, or certain class schedules, helping the university understand when parking will be most challenging. By having this information, the university can make informed decisions about parking management, like adding more parking spaces, adjusting parking regulations, or implementing better signage to direct drivers to available spots.

Moreover, this predictive approach can help enhance the overall user experience by reducing the time spent searching for parking. When students and staff have better access to real-time information about available parking, they are less likely to feel frustrated and stressed. Additionally, the university can use this data to encourage more sustainable transportation options, such as carpooling or using public transport, which can help reduce the number of cars on campus and minimize traffic congestion.

Overall, using a predictive model for parking at Morgan University not only improves the parking experience but also contributes to a more organized and environmentally friendly campus. By understanding and anticipating parking needs, the university can create a more efficient system that benefits everyone in the Morgan community.
