First, I prepared my elevator pitch. It was like a short and catchy summary of my idea that I could explain quickly to anyone. I made sure to include what my idea was about, why it was important, and who it helped. This way, I could grab people's interest right away and make them curious about my project.

Next, I worked on the prototype. It was basically a basic version of my idea that showed how it worked. I focused on making sure it demonstrated the main features clearly and worked smoothly. Testing it out helped me find any problems and fix them before I showed it to others.

I had already finished the introduction of my research paper. It was like the beginning part that explained what my research was all about and why it mattered. I made sure to describe what I studied, how I studied it, and what new things my research could teach us.

Then, I worked towards delivering my final speech. It was my chance to talk about my project to a group of people. I organized my speech into parts: first, I introduced myself and my topic clearly; then, I explained the most important points in a way that was easy to understand and exciting; and finally, I wrapped it up by summarizing why my project was meaningful and what impact it could have.
