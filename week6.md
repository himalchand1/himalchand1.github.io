On Monday morning, our main goal at the lab was to take detailed photos of our parking garage. These photos were crucial for testing our prototype in a real-world setting. However, it was harder than we expected because we didn't have a drone or a good camera angle. Despite the challenges, we managed to capture some footage and photos for our initial tests.

After the photo session, we went back to the lab and started improving our prototype. We spent the rest of Monday analyzing the photos and adjusting our design based on what we learned.

During the week, we shifted focus to preparing our presentation. Tuesday was dedicated to creating slides and organizing our progress, milestones, challenges, and strategies.

Unexpectedly, our presentation got postponed on Wednesday due to technical issues. Instead, we had a valuable discussion session with other project teams. We shared updates and exchanged ideas on how to work together effectively.

After the discussion, we returned to the lab with new energy. We continued refining our prototype based on insights from the discussion. Thursday and Friday were spent experimenting and fine-tuning the prototype's performance. Despite struggles with camera angles and photo quality, we persisted and made progress.

As Friday ended, we felt more determined than ever to succeed. We knew the road ahead might be tough, but we were confident that our teamwork and perseverance would lead us to success
