At the beginning of the week, we had a session scheduled with Anita Pandey, but it got canceled for some reason. Instead, we went straight to our lab and began working on our prototype. I attempted coding in Colab initially, but faced difficulties, so my mentor guided me in using PyCharm. It was challenging at first, but with practice and consistent effort, it gradually became easier to use.

The day began with reading a research paper, followed by presenting our project to high school students. We prepared a detailed presentation explaining our project and showcased our prototype. The students were engaged and asked insightful questions, which we were delighted to answer. It was a rewarding experience to share our work with them and receive their positive feedback.

During this week, I dedicated much of my time to learning PyCharm and exploring new research papers. I was particularly excited about mastering a new Integrated Development Environment (IDE). By Friday, I had prepared a detailed presentation summarizing our week's progress. Additionally, my group and I created a video where we discussed our accomplishments and outlined our future objectives. It was fulfilling to consolidate our learning and plans into a cohesive update for our project.
