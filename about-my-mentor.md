## About My Mentor

Pelumi Abiodun and Oludare Owolabi are my graduate mentor and faculty mentors. They are both very friendly and supportive. I especially want to highlight Pelumi, who has been an amazing mentor. Whenever I faced any problems or challenges, Pelumi was always there to help me out. He is very skilled and knowledgeable. In fact, he has three different degrees and is now working on his second Ph.D. at Morgan State University. His dedication and expertise have made a huge difference in my academic journey.
