On Monday, I came to the lab excited to work on my prototype again. But I faced challenges because we didn't have clear photos or good camera angles to guide the coding. This problem continued into Tuesday, even though I tried hard. Despite these difficulties, I made some progress by reading two new research papers and watching a helpful coding tutorial on YouTube. My mentor also gave me valuable advice and support, which really helped me deal with these 

Then, a sudden email from Dr. Naja changed our focus. We were informed that we needed to deliver a presentation on Wednesday detailing our progress, improvements, and insights gained from our research endeavors. This announcement prompted an immediate shift in priorities, and I dedicated myself to preparing for the presentation.

On presentation day, I was quite nervous because it was my first time presenting in front of such a large audience. However, I had prepared well. Our turn came second, and afterwards, everyone complimented us on our excellent presentation. We spent the rest of the day listening to other groups' presentations.

Then, on Thursday and Friday, I returned to the lab and began working on building my prototype. I also dedicated time to reading more research papers to further enhance my understanding.
