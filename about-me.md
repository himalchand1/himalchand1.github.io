## About Me

I am currently a junior at Morgan State University, located in Baltimore, Maryland. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and expect to graduate in 2025. I am passionate about technology and love learning about programming, software development, and how computers work.
In addition to my studies, I have a strong interest in sports, especially cricket. I enjoy playing cricket with friends and following the sport, as it allows me to stay active and have fun. Balancing my studies and my love for cricket keeps me motivated and energized. .
