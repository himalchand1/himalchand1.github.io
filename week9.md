Last Monday, we had an engaging session with representatives from various agencies who discussed the positive impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and how it can be harnessed for good. The speakers highlighted numerous ways AI is being used to address pressing societal challenges, from healthcare to environmental conservation, and emphasized the potential for AI to drive positive change in our communities.

After the two-hour session, which was both inspiring and informative, I returned to the lab to continue working on the final draft of our project, as well as the presentation and symposium for the final presentation. I felt motivated by the session, but also a bit overwhelmed by the amount of work that still needed to be done.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was with the coding part of our prototype for the Northern Garage. Despite my efforts, I was struggling to get the code to function correctly. This prototype is a crucial component of our project, designed to predict parking availability and improve parking management at our urban university. I spent several hours trying different approaches and troubleshooting various issues, but progress was slow.

Feeling the pressure of the impending deadlines, I decided to take a short break to clear my mind. Sometimes, stepping away from a problem can provide new perspectives and solutions. After the break, I returned to the coding with renewed focus and determination. Gradually, I started making headway, debugging the errors one by one. The process was painstaking, but each small victory brought me closer to a working prototype.

By the end of the day, I had made significant progress, though there was still work to be done. The session with the agency representatives had not only provided valuable insights into the positive uses of AI but also reinforced the importance of perseverance and problem-solving in the face of challenges. With a clearer vision and a bit more confidence, I felt ready to tackle the remaining tasks and bring our project to fruition.
