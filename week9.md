Monday:
On Monday, we had a session with agency representatives discussing the positive impacts of AI. After the two-hour session, I went back to the lab to work on our final project draft, presentation, and symposium preparations. I struggled with coding the Northern Garage prototype but made some progress by the end of the day.
On Tuesday, I reviewed the prototype and researched solutions for coding issues. I implemented new strategies and refined our presentation materials. In the evening, we had a team meeting to discuss progress and improve the slides.
Wednesday was spent integrating real-time data into the prototype and testing its accuracy. I documented the results and made adjustments. In the evening, we rehearsed the symposium presentation and made necessary improvements.
On Thursday, I continued refining the prototype and started compiling a user guide. We did another round of rehearsals for the presentation, focusing on timing and transitions. By evening, we felt prepared for the final presentation.
Friday was the day of the final presentation. We arrived early to set up and ensure everything was working. The presentation went well, with positive feedback from the audience. In the afternoon, we reflected on our hard work and celebrated our success.
