Firstly, i am thankful to Dr Naja for giving me such a great oppertunities to learn somting about Artificial intelligence. This internship gonna be so helpful for me to know more about AI and the skill that i will learn from this intern will be so helpful for me to work in AI field in future.

During the first week, I met with Dr. Oludare and my mentor, Pelumi, to discuss the project I will be working on and to understand Dr. Oludare's expectations. It was a wonderful experience with such talented and helpful mentors who support me at every step. We had dinner together and talked about how we can excel in our project. After dinner, we went to the lab, and Pelumi introduced me to the lab and provided a computer for my future work.

That week, I deepened my knowledge of Python and improved my skills. I also had the chance to meet and listen to many remarkable researchers working on different topics. They shared insights on how to conduct good research, which helped me understand how to make my research the best it can be.

Learning was my main goal, and I achieved it. I learned about new topics like Pandas, GitHub, and many others. I am so happy to have learned about these topics because they will make my research easier. Every moment I spent here was great, and learning more about Python from excellent teachers was the best part of the week.
